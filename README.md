The Los Angeles Times' database of pesticide tests on cannabis products sold to consumers.

## About the data

Californiaâ€™s testing requirements for cannabis products contain major gaps. Over more than a year, a Times investigation documented the presence of potentially harmful chemicals. 

To understand what consumers are exposed to, the Los Angeles Times bought more than 150 products from licensed stores, as well as from tobacco shops and illicit vendors, and had them tested at three state-licensed labs, Anresco Laboratories, SC Labs and Infinite Chemical Analysis Labs. These samples were tested blind, and often with confirmation testing performed at a second lab. The tests were conducted from October 2023 to December 2024.

In addition, The Times also obtained data from private market tests conducted on behalf of vape manufacturer Raw Garden and the March and Ash dispensary chain as well as Infinite CAL and Anresco. Many of these findings were also sent by the testing labs to California regulators, eventually resulting in product recalls or embargoes.

The combined tests represent the first, comprehensive insight into contamination issues in California's cannabis supply chain. The full findings are published by [The Times online in an interactive table](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-12-19/we-tested-cannabis-products-for-pesticides-how-dirty-is-your-weed). They also are provided here in a form that allows for further analysis.

This data may be updated if additional test results become available or state actions take place.
